    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array [n_samples, n_features]
        The two dimensional array that holds the dataset. Each row is a sample, each column
        is a feature.

    y_true: array [n_samples,]
        The one dimensional array that holds the class values. Corresponds to X, such that
        y_true[i] is the class value for sample X[i].

    feature: int
        An integer corresponding to the index of the variable we wish to test.

    Returns
    -------
    predictors: dictionary of tuples: (value, prediction)
        For each item in the array, if the variable has a given value, make the given prediction.

    error: float
        The ratio of training data that this rule incorrectly predicts.
